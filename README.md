# Design-And-Implementation-Of-An-Intelligent-Security-System-For-Farm-Protection-From-Wild-Animals

## Introduction

In this project, we present the coordination of PIR-Sensor, Pi Camera, LED, and Buzzer interacting with the cloud.
Pi Camera is used to capture real-time images & motion is detected through PIR-Sensor in a farm field 24 × 7 i.e., day and night. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used primarily for image recognition and processing, due to its ability to recognize patterns in images. 

Image is captured when an animal intrudes and then image is classified as domestic or wild animal using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and deep learning technique. This classification helps in alerting the farmer by sending SMS in case of intrusion of wild animal.

## Problem Statement

What we want to solve-
To Provide an Intelligent Security System which  gives reliable security and ensures the safety of the crops which also guarantees the wellbeing of animals while warding them off as well as reduce the loss of Human Life and Injury to Human Beings.

## Objectives

Our objective is to provide a smart solution to resolve protection of the farm.
We will use PIR sensor which acts as a trigger to the camera which capture the image of the intruded animal when motion detection is sensed.
In this framework, image is captured when an animal intrudes and then the image is classified as domestic or wild animal using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deep learning technique. 

## Tech

We have used a number of technologies in this project:

- [CNN] - artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing.
- [Raspberry Pi] - low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV.
- [Python] - interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language.
